                    Start your journey with a visit to the iconic Table
                    Mountain. Take the cable car up (it’s energy-efficient and
                    offers stunning views!), or challenge yourself with a hike
                    if you’re feeling adventurous. At the top, you’ll find
                    breathtaking panoramas of the city, ocean, and sky. Remember
                    to stick to marked trails to help preserve this unique
                    ecosystem. Don’t forget your reusable water bottle and
                    camera!

                    Head south along the coast to Boulders Beach, home to a
                    thriving colony of African penguins. Watch these charming
                    birds waddle and swim, but keep a respectful distance to
                    protect their habitat. Next, continue to Cape Point, where
                    you can stand at the edge of the continent and feel the
                    power of the ocean. Take a walk along the trails and soak in
                    the natural beauty.

                    Back in the city, explore the colorful Bo-Kaap neighborhood.
                    Learn about its rich history and sample delicious Cape Malay
                    food—many local restaurants use fresh, sustainable
                    ingredients. Later, wander the V&A Waterfront, where you’ll
                    find local art, live music, and fresh seafood. Choose
                    restaurants that prioritize sustainable seafood and support
                    local artisans.

                      Start your journey with a visit to the iconic Table
                      Mountain. Take the cable car up (it’s energy-efficient and
                      offers stunning views!), or challenge yourself with a hike
                      if you’re feeling adventurous. At the top, you’ll find
                      breathtaking panoramas of the city, ocean, and sky.
                      Remember to stick to marked trails to help preserve this
                      unique ecosystem. Don’t forget your reusable water bottle
                      and camera!

                      Head south along the coast to Boulders Beach, home to a
                      thriving colony of African penguins. Watch these charming
                      birds waddle and swim, but keep a respectful distance to
                      protect their habitat. Next, continue to Cape Point, where
                      you can stand at the edge of the continent and feel the
                      power of the ocean. Take a walk along the trails and soak
                      in the natural beauty.

                      fresh seafood. Choose restaurants that prioritize
