        Discover the heart of Australia with our 10-day Outback Adventure—a
        journey designed for eco-friendly explorers and nature lovers. Together,
        we’ll camp under star-filled skies, travel by 4WD across red desert
        tracks, and connect with the land through hands-on activities that
        celebrate Australia’s unique environment and heritage.


        What You’ll Experience:

        • Camp in swags beneath the Southern Cross, embracing low-impact,
        planet-positive living

        • Explore remote trails by 4WD, bushwalk through ancient gorges, and
        spot native wildlife in their natural habitat

        • Try rock climbing, abseiling, mountain biking, and canoeing—all with a
        focus on safety and sustainability

        • Learn about Aboriginal culture, local ecology, and ways to reduce your
        environmental footprint


        Your 10-Day Itinerary:

        Day 1: Arrive in Alice Springs, meet your group, and hike the West
        MacDonnell Ranges

        Day 2: Spot rock wallabies at Simpsons Gap, bushwalk, and set up camp
        together

        Day 3: Hike and swim at Ormiston Gorge, then stargaze and share stories

        Day 4: 4WD to Glen Helen, visit Aboriginal sites, and cook over a
        campfire

        Day 5: Take on the Kings Canyon rim walk, try abseiling, and camp in the
        wilderness

        Day 6: Experience a sunrise camel trek at Uluru, hike Kata Tjuta, and
        enjoy a cultural sunset

        Day 7: Cross the desert by 4WD to Curtin Springs, visit a working cattle
        station

        Day 8: Ride mountain bikes in the Great Western Woodlands, track
        wildlife, and learn bush skills

        Day 9: Explore Finke Gorge’s Palm Valley, discover rare plants, and
        cross rivers

        Day 10: Return to Alice Springs, walk the historic Telegraph Station,
        and reflect on your journey


        Join us for an adventure that’s as much about community and learning as
        it is about excitement. Every step you take helps protect Australia’s
        wild places and supports local communities. Let’s make a positive
        impact—together!
